# The Documenter build, on the default Documenter HTML theme with two plugins:
# DocumenterLandingPage renders the VitePress-style landing page (hero + emoji
# capability tiles) from the YAML frontmatter in docs/src/index.md, and
# DocumenterCodeBlocks enhances the code blocks (line numbers, reference
# links, hover tooltips, JuliaSyntax highlighting). `doctest = false` on
# purpose: the guide pages carry illustrative Julia rather than executable
# examples, because executing any of them would compile XLA programs and turn
# the docs build into a GPU-hours exercise. The API page reads docstrings only,
# which is the point of @autodocs.
#
# The landing page frontmatter (docs/src/index.md) is exactly the VitePress
# home layout the docs previously carried under DocumenterVitepress; the
# plugin replaces the block with rendered HTML at build time.
